# Awesome Vintage LLMs [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of **vintage large language models** — also called *historical LLMs*, *time-capsule LLMs*, or *time-locked LLMs* — together with the papers, datasets, demos, and discussions surrounding them.

A *vintage LLM* is a language model trained (typically *from scratch*) on text from a bounded historical period, with no information from after a given knowledge-cutoff date in its training corpus. The goal is to produce a model that does not merely *roleplay* a historical era when prompted, but whose vocabulary, worldview, and "mental furniture" are genuinely shaped by the textual culture of that period. The term *vintage LLM* was popularised by Owain Evans in his ["Vintage Large Language Models"](https://owainevans.github.io/talk-transcript.html) talk; for a humanist's perspective on the emerging field, see Benjamin Breen's essay ["Are 'Vintage LLMs' the start of a new humanistic field?"](https://resobscura.substack.com/p/are-vintage-llms-the-start-of-a-new).

These models are interesting because they enable, among other things:

- Counterfactual experiments (e.g. *can a pre-1915 model independently arrive at general relativity?*)
- Contamination-free benchmarks for temporal generalisation and forecasting
- Research in the digital humanities, social sciences, and history of ideas
- Aggregate "windows into the past" for studying period vocabulary, rhetoric, and assumptions

### MonadGPT (2023)

> *"What would have happened if ChatGPT was invented in the 17th century?"*

A 7B-parameter chatbot fine-tuned by **Pierre-Carl Langlais** (Pclanglais) from **Mistral-Hermes 2** on roughly 11,000 early-modern texts in English, French, and Latin (≈1400–1700 CE), drawn primarily from [EEBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_English_Books_Online) and [Gallica](https://gallica.bnf.fr/). MonadGPT replies in archaic language and frequently invokes pre-modern references; it is in many ways the spiritual ancestor of the more recent train-from-scratch projects below, although it is technically a *fine-tune* rather than a clean-room vintage model. Released November 2023, it predates the term "vintage LLM" but is widely cited as an early example of the idea.

### TimeCapsuleLLM (2025–2026)

A series of models trained *from scratch* on London texts published between **1800 and 1875** by **Hayk Grigorian** (with academic supervision from Dr. Hamed Yaghoobian at Muhlenberg College). Versions range from a tiny 16M-parameter `v0` built on nanoGPT to a 1.2B-parameter `v2` trained on a 90 GB corpus of 136,344 documents. The `v1` model famously connected the year 1834 with Lord Palmerston and a real London protest unprompted, demonstrating that a small model trained only on period sources can surface genuine historical patterns from primary sources alone.

### Ranke-4B / History LLMs (2025–2026)

A family of 4B-parameter models based on the **Qwen3** architecture, trained from scratch on 80B tokens of carefully time-stamped historical text drawn from a curated 600B-token dataset. Each model in the family has a fixed knowledge cutoff: **1913, 1929, 1933, 1939, or 1946**. The project is led by **Daniel Göttlich, Dominik Loibner, Guohui Jiang, and Hans-Joachim Voth** at the University of Zurich and Cologne University. Ranke-4B-1913 famously does not know who Adolf Hitler is (its closest match is a Hessian philosopher of the 19th century). The project explicitly aims to preserve, rather than scrub away, the normative judgements acquired during pre-training, treating the resulting prejudices and worldviews as a *feature* for historical research rather than a bug to be sanitised.

### Machina Mirabilis / GPT-1900 (2026)

An experiment by **Michael Hla** asking whether a 3.3B-parameter LLM trained from scratch on **pre-1900** text can independently arrive at quantum mechanics and relativity, directly testing Demis Hassabis's well-known proposal. The pre-training corpus (~22B tokens) was assembled from Institutional Books, the British Library Books dataset, and American Stories newspapers, and aggressively filtered to remove any document referencing Einstein, quantum mechanics, or other post-1900 physics. After mid-training on ~290M tokens of pre-1900 physics texts and a careful instruction-tuning + RL post-training pipeline, the model shows "glimpses of intuition" — for example, occasionally asserting that light "is made up of definite quantities of energy" or that gravity and acceleration are locally equivalent — but the author is openly cautious about claiming genuine out-of-distribution reasoning.

### Mr. Chatterbox (2026)

A ~340M-parameter chatbot (roughly the size of GPT-2-Medium) trained from scratch by **Trip Venturella** on 28,035 Victorian-era British texts published between **1837 and 1899**, drawn from the British Library's `blbooks` dataset. Built using Andrej Karpathy's [nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat), it totals approximately 2.93 billion training tokens after filtering. The model is unapologetically weak compared to frontier systems — illustrating just how data-hungry "public-domain-only" LLMs are — but it is one of the cleanest demonstrations that an entirely out-of-copyright LLM is feasible on modest hardware, and it does answer in a recognisably 19th-century voice.

### Talkie-1930 (2026)

The largest publicly released vintage LLM to date: a **13B-parameter** model trained on 260B tokens of pre-1931 English-language text (books, newspapers, periodicals, scientific journals, patents, and case law), built by **Alec Radford** (co-creator of GPT), **Nick Levine**, and **David Duvenaud**. The 1930 cutoff was chosen because U.S. copyright law places texts from that year into the public domain. The team also released `talkie-web-13b-base`, a "modern twin" with identical architecture and training FLOPs but trained on FineWeb, to enable controlled comparisons. The instruction-tuned `talkie-1930-13b-it` was post-trained without any modern chat data — instead using QA pairs extracted from pre-1931 etiquette manuals, encyclopaedias, letter-writing guides, and poetry collections, plus online DPO with an LLM-as-judge.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! This is a young, fast-moving field, and the list above is certainly incomplete. To suggest an addition or correction, please open a pull request that:

1. Adds the project in the appropriate chronological position.
2. Uses the same field structure as existing entries (short description; then GitHub, website / demo, paper, source HuggingFace, quantised / fine-tuned HuggingFace artefacts, reputable online publications, Hacker News discussions — as applicable).
3. Cites only reputable sources (academic venues, established publications, official author write-ups, well-known technical blogs). Please avoid SEO blogspam and AI-generated summaries.
4. Prefers project-from-scratch *vintage* models over plain fine-tunes or "system-prompt cosplay" of modern LLMs, although carefully-scoped fine-tunes (such as MonadGPT) are in scope.

Please also feel free to open issues to discuss whether a borderline project belongs on the list.
